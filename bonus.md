(optional) TODO!

1. Logout button which is not in the spec
2. Button to show all channel members in each channel
3. Channel list: show a joined badge on each channel that the authorised user is a member of,
   so that user don't need to click on each channel to check whether they are a member or not.
   Can be really handy for the user when the server have too many public channels.
4. Messages: shows a filled pin icon when message is pinned, an empty pin icon when message is not pinned
5. Frontend extra validation:
   - Channel Creation: channel name cannot be empty
6. Designed Logo and Favicon!
7. Designed user interface!
8. Smooth user experience!
9. (Halloween edition reaction)
